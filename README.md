# Analysing Robot Performance in Python
This analysis is performed on data from robotics sessions at the College of Charleston in South Carolina. The variables of interest are stress, attention, mental workload, and robot predictability. The impact of robot number, speed, and orientation are analysed through single-variable correlations. The speed vs robot number and speed vs orientation are analysed with two-variable correlations. The Jupyter Notebook produces a file each for the single- and two-variable correlations, and correlation matrices for the desired comparisons (contained in the `plots` directory).
