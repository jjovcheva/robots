# Analysing Robot Performance in Python
This analysis is performed on data from robotics sessions at the College of Charleston in South Carolina. The variables of interest are stress, attention, mental workload, and robot predictability. We are interested in the following relationships: 

__Single-factor__
- Robots: one robot sessions (abcd) vs two robot sessions (efgh)
- Speed: fast sessions (cdh) vs slow sessions (abg) vs 1 fast 1 slow (ef)
- Orientation: right focus (acf) vs left focus (bde)

__Two-factor__
- Speed v Robot Number: one robot slow (ab) vs two robots slow(g) and one robot fast (cd) vs two robots fast (h)
- Speed v Orientation: right robot slow (ae) vs left robot slow (bf) and right robot fast (cf) vs left robot fast (de)
